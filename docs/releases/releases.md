## ðŸŸ¢ LTS Releases

*Latest LTS: [XCP-ng 8.2](release-8-2.md)*

Using the Long Term Support version is recommended if:

* you want to ensure system stability
* you prefer receiving security fixes without needing to perform major upgrades annually
* you need a predictable migration path over a longer timeframe
* you are not concerned about missing new features for a few years

LTS releases are supported for up to 5 years:

```

If you prefer to get the latest improvements, go for our [latest release](/releases/release-8-3/).

## ðŸŸ¡ Standard Release

*Latest: [XCP-ng 8.3](release-8-3.md)*

Using the standard release is recommended if:

* you want access to the latest features and enhancements
* you need support for the newest hardware
* you want to benefit from improved performance
* you don't mind upgrading approximately twice a year

Standard releases are supported until the next release, plus a few additional months to allow time for transitioning. Check the support dates [in the table above](#xcp-ng-release-history).

If you prefer a more conservative approach, consider choosing our [LTS release](#-lts-releases).

:::note
XCP-ng 8.3 is special in the following ways:
* After the General Availability release, XCP-ng 8.3 will continue to receive updates, allowing us to introduce new features while maintaining platform stability through improved testing processes.
* Over time, XCP-ng 8.3 will transition to a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, where only bug fixes and security patches will be applied, ensuring maximum stability.

## ðŸ”´ Pre Releases

Using a pre-release is relevant only for testing purposes. Check [the `Release` tag on our blog](https://xcp-ng.org/blog/tag/release/) for (pre-)release announcements.

:::warning
### Important Note on Pre-Releases

Pre-releases are designed for testing before final General Availability. Although generally stable, they are **NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION USE**. Key considerations include:

* Security Patches: Pre-releases may not receive urgent security updates as promptly as production-grade releases.
* Commercial Support: Vates does not offer commercial support for pre-releases until they are officially finalized.

For these reasons, pre-releases should be used strictly for testing.
